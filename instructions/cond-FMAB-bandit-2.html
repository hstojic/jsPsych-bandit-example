<p>You can think of each option as a bag of coins. The coins are put in each bag before the game starts and every time you choose an option you draw a coin from the bag. Coins in the bag usually differ in value. Once you draw a coin (choose an option), you will be shown the value of it immediately below the option. Each bag can differ in the average value of the coins it contains. Some options are better than others and you can find that out by choosing options and observing the values you get. Options have horizontal and vertical lines of different lengths drawn inside the squares. The lines can help you predict the value of the coins in each bag. Throughout the game you collect experimental points and with each choice the amount increases for option's value.</p>

<p>The label denoting the option (e.g., &quot;Option B&quot;) and option's position on the screen are determined randomly before the experiment starts. Label and position can help you locate a particular option, but they are not related to the amount of rewards you can get from an option. E.g., Option B is not necessarily the best because B comes before M in the alphabet, or options S and M are not necessarily good because they are in the same region of the screen. </p>
