<p>There are 10 rounds in the game and in each round you will need to choose a single option. In the first round you will know almost nothing about the options and will have to guess which option will help you receive as many points as possible. With time you can learn about the options and make better choices. The more points you earn during the game, the more money you will receive for your participation. At the end of the experiment we will convert points you have earned to money (1800 points equals 1 dollar). Depending on your performance in the experiment you may earn up to 1.7 US dollars. On top of this money you will receive a flat payment of 0.7 US dollars for your participation.</p>
