<h1>The game</h1>

<p><strong>Please read these instructions carefully. They will allow you to perform better in the task and substantially improve the earnings in the experiment. In addition, we will ask you a few questions about what you have read and you will be able to proceed to the experiment only if you answer all the questions correctly, otherwise you will be returned to the instructions again.</strong></p> 

<p>The study consists of two parts. Below are the instructions for the first part. Instructions for the second part will be given later on, after you have completed the first part.</p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p>In the first part you will play a game in which you choose between different options, as shown on the image below. Each option is represented as a red button. Options that you get will stay there throughout the game and you will repeatedly choose between them. You can choose an option by clicking on it with a mouse. Once you have made your choice, you will earn a number of points, depending on which option you chose. This will be shown immediately below the chosen option. <strong>Your goal in the game is to earn as many points as possible.</strong></p>
