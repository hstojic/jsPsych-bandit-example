<h1 >Welcome to our experiment!</h1>

<p>In this study you will play a decision-making game. Results collected will allow us to better understand how people make decisions. The estimated time to complete the study is 10 minutes, but some people might need less or more time. If you complete the study, you will be compensated for your time and effort with money.</p>

<p><strong>It is very important that you do not press the BACK or RELOAD button (or F5 key) on the browser, since this will abort the study. If this happens you will not be able to participate in the study again and we will not be able to compensate you for your time.</strong></p>
